Week 1 
Code Implementation:
*I have build a class Actions to create my actions(basically all the 5 bandits). So I have defined two functions inside my class, choose and update which are for choosing one of the bandits and updating the Q value based on a reward of the chosen bandit respectively.
* self.mean is the Q value of an action.
* self.N is the number of times the action Q has been chosen from the start till the current time step.
*A function run_experiment is defined which implements epsilon greedy algorithm and the mean Reward method to calculate the Q value at a time step.
*I have created a list actions which contains all the bandits and will be used for retrieving the objects of the Class Actions.
*Then I have implemented the Epsilon Greedy Algorithm and Q value learning algorithm.
*Finally using matplotlib I have plotted the data for different values of epsilon.
*I have used several numpy functions to genrate random numbers, random rewards from a distribution, to choose the maximum value from an array etc.
*I was facing some issues regarding the plots, hence I took help from my mentor and he refined the code where I was updating the Q value of an action.

I used the geeks for geeks website to understand epsilon greedy algorithm and also look at a sample code to write such an algorithm, the link is attached below:
