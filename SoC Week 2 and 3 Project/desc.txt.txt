This was a mini project based on comparing MC and Q Learning Algorithms using Taxi environment of OpenAI Gym. Documentation: https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/taxi/
Certain basic terms:
Epsilon- The exploration rate of an agent which maps to randomly picking an action as the agent tries to explore the environemnt.
Learning Rate- The factor which is responsible for updating the Q values of state-action pairs which basically shows how fast the agent learns from its experience
My Brief Analysis:
After running my Q Learning algorithm for the Taxi Game for 500 episodes, I could see for some pairs of pick up and destinations it has learnt very well as it has taken very few steps for them but for certain pairs it is still performing poorly. Before these 500 episodes, I had run 200-300 episodes where I had kept the epsilon 0.01 but for this 500 episodes I have kept it as 0.001 as I feel that after certain number of episodes relative Q values have been established and the agent should take the max Q value actions to save time but at the same time epsilon shall not be decreased to a very low value as the exploration would decrease which is again inefficient for those pairs of destinations and pick ups where the agent is still performing poorly. One more observation is that learning rate should be kept high in the start but as we proceed it should be reduced slightly but not too much so that Q values are more or less stabilised. I could see finally that Q Learning more or less works good and learns very fast as it updates the Q values after each step in an episode unlike Monte Carlo(I have taken screenshots of my observations and graphs)
For the Monte Carlo simulation, I had kept the parameters more or  less same and had also run it for 500 episodes, the results were disappointing as it could not learn as how well Q Learning did. the reasons could be its slow rate of learning, less strict corrective action as it gives the feedback only after the completion of an episode, high variance of data as the return G is taken after the end of episode etc.(I also have taken screenshots for it)
